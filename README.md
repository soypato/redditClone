## Description
This project aims to showcase a Reddit clone, as follows:

- We have a .json file that acts as a database, where there is information about posts, descriptions, images, reddits, and fictitious users.
- If we with Express find that the path entered by the user matches the data in the .JSON, we render the page to display it (subreddit.ejs).
- If we don't find it, we tell the user that the page doesn't exist (like a 404), and render the page to display it (notfound.ejs).

In this project we use the following technologies:
- NodeJS to run it on the server.
- ExpressJS for routing and rendering.
- EJS as a markup language to take advantage of ExpressJS.
- Bootstrap for layout.
